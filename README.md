![alt text](logos_cimcaves/logo2_cimcaves.jpg)

This website contains supplementary information that helps to fill the survey about cummulative impacts on marine caves from the investigation **CIMcaves** led by the University of La Laguna (Spain), in which the collaborating organizations are the Ionian University (Greece), the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (Spain) and the University of Burgos (Spain).

Here you can find material such as definitions, the ecoregions of the world so that you can find yours, the criteria for evaluating pressures with examples, and selected bibliography.

If you are a scientist working for a university, research institution, government agency, NGO, or private company with some knowledge of marine caves, or if you are an experienced diver in marine caves, we would love for you to participate in this survey.
